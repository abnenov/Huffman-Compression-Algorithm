# Huffman Compression Algorithm

A Python implementation of the Huffman algorithm for lossless data compression.

## Description

This project contains an implementation of the classic Huffman coding algorithm for data compression. The algorithm uses the frequency of occurrence of symbols in text to determine optimal variable-length codes, achieving lossless compression.

## Features

- Huffman tree construction based on symbol frequencies
- Prefix code generation for each symbol
- Encoding (compression) of text
- Decoding (decompression) of compressed text
- Compression ratio calculation
- Storage and loading of the Huffman tree

## Theoretical Foundation

The project includes research on the theoretical foundations of the algorithm, explanation of information entropy, and comparison with other compression methods.
